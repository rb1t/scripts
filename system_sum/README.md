# Archsumm
_(Arch Linux system summary)_
Prints a report of installed packages (including AUR and Discover), as well as some other basic system information. Helpful for quickly setting up a new system with prior recorded specs.

*Usage:* Simply run the `.sh` script. Store/backup the file generated in the output directory for future use :)
